# Flask Application CI/CD Pipeline

This repository contains a Jenkins pipeline for automating the testing and deployment of a Flask application.

## Setup

1. Install Jenkins and configure with Python and necessary libraries.
2. Fork and clone this repository.
3. Configure the Jenkins pipeline to trigger on code changes.
4. Set up email notifications in Jenkins for build results.

## Jenkins Pipeline

The Jenkins pipeline defined in the Jenkinsfile performs the following stages:
- Build: Installs dependencies using pip.
- Test: Runs unit tests using pytest.
- Deploy: Deploys the application using Fabric.

## Triggers

The pipeline is triggered automatically on code changes pushed to the main branch of the repository.

## Notifications

Email notifications are sent for build success and failure.

To complete the assignment, follow these detailed steps:

1. Setup Jenkins:
Install Jenkins on a virtual machine or use a cloud-based Jenkins service.
Ensure Python and necessary libraries are installed on the Jenkins server.
Install Jenkins: You can install Jenkins on a virtual machine or use a cloud-based Jenkins service like Jenkins on Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud Platform. Follow the installation instructions provided by Jenkins for your specific environment.

Configure Jenkins with Python and necessary libraries: After installing Jenkins, ensure that Python is installed on your Jenkins server. You'll also need to install any necessary Python libraries that your Flask application requires. You can do this using pip, the Python package installer, by running pip install <package_name>.

2. Source Code:
Fork the provided Python web application repository on GitHub. You can use a sample Python web application repository like this: Sample Flask App.

Clone the forked repository into your Jenkins server:
git clone <forked_repository_url>

Fork the provided Python web application repository on GitHub: You need a sample Python web application repository to work with. The provided link to the Flask repository can serve as your sample application. Fork this repository to your GitHub account.

Clone the forked repository into your Jenkins server: Once you've forked the repository, clone it onto your Jenkins server using the git clone <repository_url> command.


3. Jenkins Pipeline:
Create a Jenkinsfile in the root of your Python application repository. The Jenkinsfile defines the pipeline.

Create a Jenkinsfile: Jenkins pipelines are defined using a Jenkinsfile which is placed in the root of your project repository. The Jenkinsfile is written in Groovy syntax.

Define pipeline stages: In your Jenkinsfile, define the different stages of your pipeline. These stages typically include building, testing, and deploying your application.

Define a pipeline with the following stages:

groovy
Copy code
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'pytest'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                // Your deployment steps here
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        success {
            mail to: 'your_email@example.com',
            subject: 'Pipeline Success',
            body: 'Your pipeline has succeeded.'
        }
        failure {
            mail to: 'your_email@example.com',
            subject: 'Pipeline Failure',
            body: 'Your pipeline has failed.'
        }
    }
}

4. Triggers:
Configure the pipeline to trigger a new build whenever changes are pushed to the main branch of the repository. You can set up GitHub webhook in Jenkins to trigger the build on code push events.

Configure pipeline triggers: Jenkins pipelines can be triggered manually or automatically. To automatically trigger builds whenever changes are pushed to the main branch of your repository, you can set up GitHub webhooks in Jenkins. This allows Jenkins to receive notifications from GitHub whenever there's a new commit.

5. Notifications:
Set up Jenkins to send email notifications when the build process fails or succeeds. You may need to configure email settings in Jenkins before using this feature.

Set up email notifications: Jenkins provides built-in support for email notifications. You can configure Jenkins to send email notifications to specified recipients when a build succeeds or fails. Before configuring email notifications, you may need to set up an SMTP server in Jenkins.
Set up email notifications:
Configure Jenkins to send email notifications using the Extended Email plugin. Go to Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > Configure System, and configure your SMTP server details.

6. Documentation:
Document the pipeline process and any prerequisites needed for the setup in a README.md file in the repository. Include instructions for setting up Jenkins, configuring the pipeline, and any other relevant information.




# QUESTION - 2 *********************************************************************************

To complete the assignment, follow these steps:

1. Setting up the Repository
You need to create a GitHub repository for your Python application. For this assignment, you can use a sample Flask application. Here's a simple Flask application repository you can use: Flask-Sample-App.

Ensure your repository has two branches: main and staging.

Create a new repository on GitHub or use an existing one. For this example, let's assume the repository is named "Flask-Sample-App". Make sure you have a main and staging branch.

2. GitHub Actions Workflow
Create a .github/workflows directory in your repository.
Inside the directory, create a YAML file to define the workflow, such as ci_cd_pipeline.yml.
Create a new directory named .github/workflows in the root of your repository. Inside this directory, create a YAML file named ci_cd_pipeline.yml. This file will define your GitHub Actions workflow.

3. Workflow Steps
CODE PRESENT ON .github folder

4. Environment Secrets
You need to use GitHub Secrets to store sensitive information like deployment keys or API tokens.

Go to your GitHub repository.
Click on "Settings".
Go to "Secrets".
Add your sensitive information as secrets.

To store sensitive information like deployment keys or API tokens, you need to use GitHub Secrets:

Go to your GitHub repository.
Click on "Settings".
Go to "Secrets".
Add your secrets. For example, you might add SSH_PRIVATE_KEY, STAGING_SERVER, PRODUCTION_SERVER, etc.

Environment Secrets
Sensitive information required for deployments, such as SSH keys or API tokens, is stored securely using GitHub Secrets. Make sure to configure the following secrets in your repository settings:

SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: Private SSH key for accessing deployment servers.
STAGING_SERVER: Hostname or IP address of the staging server.
PRODUCTION_SERVER: Hostname or IP address of the production server.
